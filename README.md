# My-academic-journey

I’m a 17-year-old student currently studying at Botswana Accountancy College. My academic journey began at Itumeleng Primary School, where I laid the foundations of my education. From there, I progressed to Sir Seretse Khama CJSS for my Junior Secondary Education, and later to Ledumang Senior Secondary School for my BGCSE studies.

Throughout my schooling, success didn’t come easily. I faced many challenges and often wondered if I would be able to make it through. There were moments of doubt and struggle, but I never gave up. My hard work paid off when I barely managed to secure a government scholarship, achieving 37 points, just above the minimum requirement of 36. That achievement was a turning point for me, filling me with pride, relief, and a renewed sense of determination.

Transitioning to tertiary education was another source of anxiety. The unfamiliar setting, higher expectations, and new responsibilities initially made me nervous and unsure of myself. However, I learned to calm my fears, adapt to the environment, and embrace the opportunities that college life offered.

Today, I continue to navigate this new chapter with resilience and optimism, determined to grow academically and personally, and to make the most of the opportunities that have been granted to me.
